## About
Finance is an important part of the life of any people. Sometimes you think about getting additional income and want to open a deposit account. And sometimes you need additional money right now and want to take a credit or mortgage. Anyway, you may want to calculate different financial indicators to make a decision. Let’s make such an instrument that can help us.

## Learning Outcomes
You’ll learn how to use mathematics and Python in everyday tasks, use third-party modules and libraries. Also, you’ll learn more about different financial instruments. Finally, you will make your own credit calculator!

## Steps
1. Create a simple program which will print messages about some credit. 
2. Communicate with the user to get necessary values, do simple mathematical operations and output the result.
3. Calculate real credit parameters by using the mathematical capabilities of Python. 
4. Make the credit calculator be able to work with different types of payment and to work with command-line arguments.
